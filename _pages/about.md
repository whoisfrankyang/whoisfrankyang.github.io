Computer Science @ [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu)

Hi! I'm Bohan Yang, a fourth-year undergraduate student at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science.

I work with [Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee](https://sites.google.com/site/tapomayukh) and [Sarah Dean](https://sdean.website) on assistive robotics and human-in-the-loop robot learning at [Cornell EmPRISE Lab](https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu). I also collaborate with [Weiqing Gu](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/faculty-staff/gu/) at [Data-to-Decision](https://data-to-decision.com) on AI for clinical voice analysis.

I'm broadly interested in post-deployment robot learning — how robots can recognize uncertainty, ask for help when needed, and learn continuously over their lifetime.
